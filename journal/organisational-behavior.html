							<p class="text-black leading-normal pb-3">Leader Dhoni has got selected as a captain of India at times when he was a new entrant in the team. It was a recommendation from Sachin to the board to make him captain as he already identified Dhoni’s potentialities to lead the team. </p>

							<p class="text-black leading-normal pb-3">Dhoni has always been interactive with the team members. Being a wicket-keeper he was at the center and used to communicate, give suggestions read the game. This gave exposure to the big player’s attention in the team. The conversations led them into believing that Dhoni could be a good leader. It teaches lessons to young people to have good communication with teammates, to have better results. The best trait that needs to be mentioned is that he is always ready to accept the responsibility for a mistake than putting up a claim for his leadership when there is a success. </p>
							<p class="text-black leading-normal pb-3">This is very true about a great leader as the leader has to assume all responsibilities at the time of failure and give credit to the entire team for success instead of claiming for it himself. Strengths of MSD that make him very special Leader It is said that leaders are born and not made. But this probably is proved wrong by M. S. Dhoni. His qualities as manager and leader have been dissected, debated, and discussed y sports journalists and management groups. A leader is said to be good when he/she knows exactly how to manage their people and take all responsibilities to deliver when the team is down. </p>
							<p class="text-black leading-normal pb-3">There are different qualities of a leader who always tries to look ahead and keep motivating his team. The team always needs his support at the time of fall and it is the leader who takes away the team from getting caught in a problem. He/ she needs to possess a combination of many such traits which will prove his/her ability to handle the situation. All these attributes are furthermore classified as below. </p>
							<p class="text-black leading-normal pb-3">1. Strong Interaction with the team: A great leader always wants his teammates to be well aware of all objectives, goals, and available resources. Therefore he/she tries to communicate more and more with all team members in order to overcome the obstacles. In communication, the message will be passed clearly. According to Dhoni most times, an individual starts to doubt his talent before the other doubts him. That individual doesn’t trust his own ability and the self-belief goes missing. Dhoni is very particular in such times and chooses words very carefully while interacting with teammates. So, communication or interaction becomes very crucial. Dhoni believes in more interaction with players and he experienced it when there was a question of leading the team even there were many senior players in the team like Sachin Tendulkar, Saurav Ganguly, VVS Laxman, Rahul Dravid. </p>
							<p class="text-black leading-normal pb-3">2. Leading from the front: A leader is always supposed to take responsibility for directing people and showing them the right path to achieve the goals. The result will not be a big matter in such time. Dhoni is such a player who always likes to carry all responsibilities on his shoulder when his team finds it difficult to move ahead. The final of World cup 2011 is the best example of it when Dhoni himself was promoted to bat at number 4 well ahead of inform Yuvraj Singh and won the world cup with an unbeaten knock of 91 runs for his country. </p>
							<p class="text-black leading-normal pb-3">3. Encouraging a Motivating the People: When the team members feel stressed and lose confidence in themselves it is the leader who should encourage the team members and come up with a better plan next time. A self-motivated leader works consistently towards his goals has extremely high standards for work. The motivation comes from within and is more positive when one compares it to extrinsic factors that affect one’s motivation. Dhoni’s locus of control is very intrinsic. He has always been seen motivating his team members. Especially if there is a new player who comes into the team and doesn’t perform well, Dhoni motivates him well enough to get back in his form and perform well. </p>
							<p class="text-black leading-normal pb-3">4. Utilizing available Resources: A leader or a manager has to look at the available resources with him/her. The focus should be on how to utilize and optimize the resources in order to get maximum output. A manager should be able to get the best out of the resources allotted to him rather than complaining about the resource. Dhoni is expert in utilizing available resources properly. The way he rotates his bowlers brings part-timers into the game so that he has a lot of options for the death over, is simply amazing. </p>
							<p class="text-black leading-normal pb-3">5. Instinct and Self Belief: On certain occasions, leaders have to believe their gut feelings based on their experience and take decisions accordingly. It does not mean that the decision taken will always be proved right. To have this gut factor the leader should possess sufficient in-hand experience. Dhoni does have good experience and he always believes in himself. He has a good instinctive ability which helps him to take fair decisions at very crucial times on the field. There were many occasions in cricket when he had led the team with certain decisions; based on his gut feelings and that had proven right at the end. In the final match of Champions trophy, he chose Ishant Sharma to bowl the crucial over even the data shown to choose Umesh Yadav to have better result and that over had turned the match for India. </p>
							<p class="text-black leading-normal pb-3">6. Backing the Teammates: A leader should always keep motivating team members by extending his support to make their performance more effective. Team members reciprocate and feel a sense of responsibility based on the trust shown by their leaders. Dhoni places immense trust in his people and backs them to deliver the best. This allows them to express themselves freely without the fear of failure. He always believes his teammates ever after they fail to deliver their performance in the game. </p>
							<p class="text-black leading-normal pb-3">7. Risk-taking ability: There is a saying in the business world that if there is more risk the probability of profits also is more. Based on the knowledge and analytical skills leaders or managers take risks to gain more profits. Dhoni too has the ability to take risks, especially in a pressured situation. The T20 world cup final against Pakistan has been a great example of it when Dhoni took a risk by asking newly entered Joginder Sharma to bowl experienced informed Misbah-ul-Haq. Finally, everyone knew the result as India lift that T20 world cup. </p>
							<p class="text-black leading-normal pb-3">8. Sharing Credit: It is the tendency of human beings that they always try to take credit for success and blame others for failure. A great leader always understands to give credit to the team and take responsibility for failure. MSD has that understanding and in the post-match presentation, interview, press conferences he never boasts about himself rather he says it’s the team effort that has won the game. This brings out the confidence in players, makes them feel secured, and inspires them to perform better under the leader. </p>
							<p class="text-black leading-normal pb-3">9. Managing Success and Failure: In the corporate world, early success need not be brash behavior towards colleagues and customers. It is a common observation that managers see success at a very younger age, lose their balance and face early career burnouts. Dhoni is blessed with early success along with the team as T20 world cup champions when he led team India first time. But he never had gone losing his control and keeps his feet on the floor. Failure also is a part of life. Therefore, the manager should not choose to fly away instead of fighting with the situation. Dhoni’s downfall began just after his team tested the success of the world cup 2011. After a string of embarrassing losses, it required a great character and attitude to bounce back which Dhoni has balanced successfully.</p>
							<p class="text-black leading-normal pb-3">10. Decision Making: A leader should be very prompt in decision making; because a wrong decision may lead to wind up the business. Dhoni takes very quick decisions as to the situation demands and makes changes accordingly.</p>
