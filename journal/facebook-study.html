							<p class="text-black leading-normal pb-3">Over the past two decades, the rise in social networking sites helping people stay in touch and share information with others has led Facebook to become a company that grew rapidly. Facebook was created exactly when social networking was on a rise, the internet was being available to everyone during that period.</p>

							<p class="text-black leading-normal pb-3">Facebook stood apart from the rest of its competitors like MySpace and Friendster because it was easily available, had better innovations for a social networking site. Facebook's efficiency in handling an increasing volume of users and an increasing network of people made Facebook a global business. Innovations within the application allowed greater use of Facebook. It was ready for people all over the world, with every other language within it. Having software engineers create more for Facebook keeping consumers in mind made the company a go-forward company. Facebook undoubtedly is a huge success. It adds a large variety of features, adjustments and has launched a variety of other apps that also became a success.</p>
							<p class="text-black leading-normal pb-3">There are key reasons which make Facebook successful. Facebook is by far the most engaging social media networking site, it is easy to use and easy to connect with people. Facebookâ€™s availability to anyone anywhere made it easy for people to spend a lot of time on it connecting with people from all over the world. Facebook played well in Public Relations, something which was required to keep the company going when it kept changing its features and privacy policies. Started as a college networking site, Facebook has thus grown massively and has stood apart since the beginning with its innovative measures to connect people.</p>
							<p class="text-black leading-normal pb-3">There are always certain risks when something has a steep rise. Facebook certainly faces risks that mostly have to do with the revenue of the company. Secluding revenues, its competitors, new technologies, and privacy concerns are a risk to the ever-growing company. Facebook is subjected to change in privacy policies, data protection, and intellectual property. These factors could significantly affect Facebook's rapid growth. Intellectual property battles, having lawsuits, property and patent claims continue to grow.</p>
							<p class="text-black leading-normal pb-3">Facebook has not made a profit over the years and is spending more on its new technologies. New competitors that keep arising every year pose a threat to Facebook and its subsidiaries. Facebook has had some downfalls in the past, falling down the charts and falling revenues aren't major problems for Facebook but the risks are not limited to only it. Facebook has been spending on new technologies like live video, virtual reality, and messaging, bringing to notice that most of the world doesn't use the internet. Bigger brands are still hesitant to move over to social media branding which makes Facebook requiring smaller businesses for advertising on their platform. The quarterly earnings of Facebook continue to be steady, but the company is set to face risks in the future when it comes to properties apart from digital. Facebook faces obstacles in advertising. Many advertisers are hesitant to advertise on social networking applications because the content is all user-generated. Facebook's collection of personal user data remains an issue that gives rise to questions regarding privacy regulations.</p>
							<p class="text-black leading-normal pb-3">Oculus which is a great technology by Facebook doesn't seem to be as successful as its sibling companies. Facebook's Whatsapp has users shifting towards other communication platforms because there was a change in its privacy laws. Facebook till now has faced a lot of hurdles on its way to success. The only risk Facebook has to worry about is its fall.</p>
