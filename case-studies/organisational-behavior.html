Patel, has joined the list of companies that have received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for their Covid-19 vaccines. Last week, Cadila said the Drug Controller General of India had approved its Made-in-India ZyCov-D, which it hopes will be available in the market by the middle to the end of September. The vaccine’s price has not yet been decided.

India has so far administered the vaccine to over 604 million people, but only 9.6% of India's population is fully inoculated against the virus. The country has been vaccinating on average between 5 and 7 million people each day.

The ZyCov-D is a three-dose vaccine, given 28 days apart. The company plans to seek approval for a two-dose regimen of the vaccine.

According to the company, the ZyCov-D is also India’s first vaccine for adolescents between 12 and 18 years of age. All the vaccines that are available now are for those above 18 years.

Apart from ZyCov-D, the regulator has approved five vaccines–Serum Institute’s Covishield, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, which was the first Made-in-India vaccine, Russia’s Sputnik V, Moderna’s vaccine, which is being facilitated by Cipla, and Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine. Johnson & Johnson has also sought permission to study its single-dose vaccine in the country.</p>

<!--
	Leader Dhoni has got selected as a captain of India at times when he was a new entrant in the team. It was a recommendation from Sachin to the board to make him captain as he already identified Dhoni’s potentialities to lead the team. Dhoni has always been interactive with the team members. Being a wicket-keeper he was at the center and used to communicate, give suggestions read the game. This gave exposure to the big player’s attention in the team. The conversations led them into believing that Dhoni could be a good leader. It teaches lessons to young people to have good communication with teammates, to have better results. The best trait that needs to be mentioned is that he is always ready to accept the responsibility for a mistake than putting up a claim for his leadership when there is a success. This is very true about a great leader as the leader has to assume all responsibilities at the time of failure and give credit to the entire team for success instead of claiming for it himself. Strengths of MSD that make him very special Leader It is said that leaders are born and not made. But this probably is proved wrong by M. S. Dhoni. His qualities as manager and leader have been dissected, debated, and discussed y sports journalists and management groups. A leader is said to be good when he/she knows exactly how to manage their people and take all responsibilities to deliver when the team is down. There are different qualities of a leader who always tries to look ahead and keep motivating his team. The team always needs his support at the time of fall and it is the leader who takes away the team from getting caught in a problem. He/ she needs to possess a combination of many such traits which will prove his/her ability to handle the situation. All these attributes are furthermore classified as below. 1. Strong Interaction with the team: A great leader always wants his teammates to be well aware of all objectives, goals, and available resources. Therefore he/she tries to communicate more and more with all team members in order to overcome the obstacles. In communication, the message will be passed clearly. According to Dhoni most times, an individual starts to doubt his talent before the other doubts him. That individual doesn’t trust his own ability and the self-belief goes missing. Dhoni is very particular in such times and chooses words very carefully while interacting with teammates. So, communication or interaction becomes very crucial. Dhoni believes in more interaction with players and he experienced it when there was a question of leading the team even there were many senior players in the team like Sachin Tendulkar, Saurav Ganguly, VVS Laxman, Rahul Dravid. 2. Leading from the front: A leader is always supposed to take responsibility for directing people and showing them the right path to achieve the goals. The result will not be a big matter in such time. Dhoni is such a player who always likes to carry all responsibilities on his shoulder when his team finds it difficult to move ahead. The final of World cup 2011 is the best example of it when Dhoni himself was promoted to bat at number 4 well ahead of inform Yuvraj Singh and won the world cup with an unbeaten knock of 91 runs for his country. 3. Encouraging a Motivating the People: When the team members feel stressed and lose confidence in themselves it is the leader who should encourage the team members and come up with a better plan next time. A self-motivated leader works consistently towards his goals has extremely high standards for work. The motivation comes from within and is more positive when one compares it to extrinsic factors that affect one’s motivation. Dhoni’s locus of control is very intrinsic. He has always been seen motivating his team members. Especially if there is a new player who comes into the team and doesn’t perform well, Dhoni motivates him well enough to get back in his form and perform well. 4. Utilizing available Resources: A leader or a manager has to look at the available resources with him/her. The focus should be on how to utilize and optimize the resources in order to get maximum output. A manager should be able to get the best out of the resources allotted to him rather than complaining about the resource. Dhoni is expert in utilizing available resources properly.
